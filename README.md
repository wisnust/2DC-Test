One of the client websites is down both on FE and BE, because of some
error on one of the plugins or themes. You only have access to the DB and
Files. What would you do?

1. **Backup:** make a secure copy of the website.
2. **Investigate the Code:** search for error messages to see what's wrong.
3. **Disable Plugins/Themes:** Disable one of the plugins was causing the issue.
4. **Check for Updates:** See if there are any updates available for plugins/themes.
5. **Investigate the Problem:** If a problem is found with a theme/plugin, focus on the problem and fix it
